# Diabetes Healthcare Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes diabetes patient data to identify key health indicators
and risk factors that influence patient outcomes. The objective is to support
preventive care and data-driven healthcare decision-making.

## 🧠 Key Questions Answered
- Which clinical factors are most associated with diabetes outcomes?
- How do glucose levels, BMI, and age impact patient risk?
- Can patients be grouped into risk categories?

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- SQL – data cleaning, filtering, and aggregation
- Python – exploratory data analysis using Pandas and NumPy
- Power BI – interactive dashboards and visual storytelling

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `data/` – Raw and cleaned diabetes datasets  
- `sql/` – SQL queries used for analysis  
- `python/` – Python notebooks for EDA  
- `powerbi/` – Power BI dashboard file  

## ✅ Key Insights
- Higher glucose and BMI levels are strongly associated with increased diabetes risk
- Age is a significant contributing factor in patient outcomes
- Certain patient segments require early monitoring and intervention

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Add predictive modeling for diabetes risk
- Include longitudinal patient data
